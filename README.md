# ChatGPT to Markdown

The point of this add-on is to get a tool that lets ya download ChatGPT info to a local file in Markdown format.

The code primarily corresponds to what is available in [the Reddit conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zm237o/save_your_chatgpt_conversation_as_a_markdown_file/) and the contributions from the comments within that discussion.
